# Morra Game CodeLine Interface

## Description

The Morra Game CodeLine Interface is a Java-based application developed as an assignment to learn about design patterns and practice Java programming. This project implements the classic Morra game, where two players simultaneously show a number of fingers, and the sum of the fingers shown by both players determines the winner of the round. The game continues for a specified number of rounds, and the player with the most wins at the end is declared the overall winner.

The application provides a command-line interface (CLI) for players to interact with the game. It focuses on implementing core Java concepts such as object-oriented design principles, inheritance, and polymorphism. Through this project, developers practice designing and structuring a Java application while gaining hands-on experience with game logic and command-line user interfaces.
